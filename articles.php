<h2 class="h-article">What is TDEE?</h2>
<p class="par-article">
  The entire quantity of calories you expend each day during 24 hours is called your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).
These calories are produced by your body while it works to keep you alive, including all of your physical activity as well as thinking,
breathing, digestion, and other bodily processes. Overall, TDEE encompasses all of your activities, including your workout regimen. <sup>[1]</sup>  

Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) or resting energy expenditure (REE) refers to all of the work your body performs while at rest (BMR). 
The BMR portion of your TDEE represents 60% to 70% of the typical person's overall expenditures. 

 Your non-resting energy expenditure (NREE) is a combination of three factors, including the thermic effect of food (TEF), non-exercise thermogenesis (NEAT),
and exercise activity thermogenesis (EAT).
The quantity of calories required for your vital processes at total mental, physical, and digestive rest is known as your basal metabolic rate (BMR). 
These actions take place automatically. </p>
<h2 class="h-article">What is BMR?</h2>
<p class="par-article">
  Your resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the number of calories needed for respiration, cognitive functions,
digestion, and blood circulation while you are at rest. For the average person,
your BMR accounts for 60% to 70% of your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). </p>
<h2 class="h-article" >What factors affect your TDEE?</h2>
<p class="par-article">
  Many factors can affect your TDEE Your daily calorie expenditure is as unique as you are. 
Everybody burns calories at different rates every day. You may build a strategy for achieving your objective, whether it be maintaining, gaining, or reducing weight,
by using our calculator to make your best estimations.
Your age, activity level, body composition, size, weight, whether you have any diseases or illnesses,
and having a higher body fat percentage compared to muscle mass, hormones, and heredity are all factors that affect your TDEE.
Your TDEE also may drop as you become older, lose weight, lead a sedentary lifestyle, have a slower metabolism, or have genetic predispositions.
The important question here is how can I improve my TDEE.</p>
<h2 class="h-article">How can I improve my TDEE?</h2>
<p class="par-article">
  The best and simplest answer is to add extra physical exercise into your day, hitting your daily steps goal or having an exercise routine 
can help you improve your TDEE
Specifically, scheduled exercise and adding more movement to your day by walking more and resting less are two short-term techniques for
raising your TDEE. <sup>[2]</sup> </p>

<p class="par-article">
*Please note that This article is a result of my personal experience and my research Please do not consider this article as from an expert.* </p>

<h2 class="h-article">What is the meaning of intuitive eating?</h2>
<p class="par-article">
  First I want to clarify the meaning of intuitive eating from a scientific aspect:
According to the National Eating Disorders Association, intuitive eating involves not criticizing yourself or being influenced by diet culture 
but rather trusting your body to choose foods that feel good for you.<sup>[1]</sup>  It means eating when you feel hungry 
and listening to your body and your intuitiveness in eating 
 </p>
<h2 class="h-article" >My personal experience</h2>
<p class="par-article">
  Ok so let’s start with my health journey, and how I felt mentally and physically by trying both strategies, and what fits me better? 
 like many other people I started my health journey by following some nutrition coaches, nutrients experts, and people that are interested in nutrition
 in general unfortunately some of them were not even experts and they sell plans and non-trusted medical advice and incorrect ideas to people,
 they also promote strict diet plans and low calories diets that give fast results but in reality, they destroy many people’s health.
So obviously and regrettably I started my journey following a strict diet plan I took calories less than my body needed and started to say no 
to many foods that I always loved just for the fear of gaining weight I have had a negative relationship with food. 
  </p>
  <p style=" margin-top: -88px;">
  A few weeks later I started to feel that there is something wrong with my mental health and also my physical health, 
I did not have the energy to do my daily tasks and even my workouts, so I decided to change this lifestyle because it did not fit me or in other words,
it does not fit anyone because it is totaly unhealthy.
And I started to read more and do my research about nutrition  but this time from trusted sources and I used one of the famous calorie counting applications 
that have balanced plans which appeared to be good for me eventually I hit my goal and I felt good about my weight, my mental health has improved 
and I had more confidence.
</p>
<h2 class="h-article">Why I did not stick to calorie counting?</h2>
<p class="par-article">
Unfortunately my daily schedule did not allow me to stick to that plan for a long time, there were those days when I could not count my calories 
because I had a busy schedule but it was not a real problem because I already reached my goal I just wanted to maintain the results,
So by chance, I saw an article about intuitive eating started to read more and more about this approach and I tried it,
and here is my final overview of both strategies.
 </p>
 <h2 class="h-article">Which is better for me intuitive eating or balanced calorie counting?</h2>
<p class="par-article">
 I would say both are good strategies are good but calorie counting would be better if you need to reach a specific goal like losing weight or gaining muscles 
on the other hand intuitive eating for me is the long-term strategy because after I tried calorie counting I had much knowledge about my body needs and 
what amount of food I need and so on so I had a wiser food choices.

 </p>
 <p style="margin-top: -80px;">
 In the end, I would say that the most important thing whether you follow any food plan is balance, 
 and any plan that promotes balance Instead of strictness and fit your goals and make you feel good both mentally and physically is a good plan, 
 and always remember that the balance in eating  what you desire and what will benefit your body is the key to reach your goal and maintain healthy habits</p>
